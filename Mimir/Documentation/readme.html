			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<h3 class="subtitle">What is ODIN?</h3>
			<p class="description">ODIN is an asset management system intended [primarily] for I.T. teams of small to medium businesses
				that need a versitile and modular inventory system to manage their equipment, but may not have the resources
				necessary to adopt and pay for expensive alternatives. ODIN was built with modularity in mind, making it easy to 
				change every part of the experience to fit your organization's needs.
			</p>
			<p class="description">Built in Python 3, ODIN uses Qt and SQLite to deliver a fully customizable GUI and saves all of its data into a SQL Database.
				This grants adminstrators the ability to sync their databases across a network and access (and ammend) various database
				entries with ease. Future versions of ODIN will include nodes that
				have network features built in &mdash; but for now, the data is saved locally and will have to be synced manually.
			</p>
			<p class="description">ODIN is made up of different components &mdash; <strong><span class="color-tyr">Týr</span></strong>, <strong><span class="color-mimir">Mimir</span></strong>, <strong><span class="color-heimdall">Heimdall</span></strong> and <strong><span class="color-forseti">Forseti</span></strong>.
				Each component serves a different purpose, but together form the entire application. These components are not different programs; they are different aspects of the program and shall be referred to independantly in the interest of ODIN's modular focus.
			</p>
			<h3 class="subtitle">Týr</h3>
			<p class="description"><span class="color-tyr">Týr</span> is the front-end of the application &ndash; the GUI users will interact with, and is built in PyQt6. It's also responsible for taking data and saving it in various formats,
				most notably SQL databases and spreadsheet exports. All functions call to <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span>; whenever you're using the application, you are interacting with <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span>.
			</p>
			<p class="subtitle">Here's what <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span> looks like:</p>
			<img class="p-img" src="https://github.com/need4swede/ODIN/blob/main/Mimir/Documentation/img/tyr/tyr-front-end.png?raw=true" alt="tyr-gui">
			<h3 class="subtitle">Mimir</h3>
			<p class="description"><span class="color-mimir">Mimir</span> is the built-in console that's designed to help users perform various tasks and increase productivity, and also acts as the mediator for applications accessing stored database entries. Currently, <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span>
				is the only application using <span class="color-mimir">Mimir</span>, but it will eventually run independantly as a CLI and will be able to perform various tasks, such as parsing through spreadsheets for entries, ammending them, merging databases and a lot more. For now, however, 
				<span class="color-mimir">Mimir</span> is built into both <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span> and <span class="color-heimdall">Heimdall</span>.
			</p>
			<p class="subtitle">The release of a standalone <span class="color-mimir">Mimir</span> console is TBD at this time.</p>
			<h3 class="subtitle">Heimdall</h3>
			<p class="description"><span class="color-heimdall">Heimdall</span>, like <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span>, is a GUI &mdash; but whereas <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span> is used by administrators to manage <span class="color-mimir">Mimir's</span> databases, <span class="color-heimdall">Heimdall</span> is intended 
				for end&ndash;users to acess and view designated entries from <span class="color-mimir">Mimir's</span> database using a routing module known as the <em>Bifröst</em>. <span class="color-heimdall">Heimdall</span> allows clients to see parts of <span class="color-mimir">Mimir's</span> database that they have been given access to,
				such as assets and equipment that's been assigned to them and their department, without giving them write abilities or full access to <span class="color-tyr">Týr's</span> admin toolset. <span class="color-heimdall">Heimdall</span> will be using the Django framework and is a seperate web&ndash;application that can be accessed
				through a browser.
			</p>
			<p class="subtitle"><span class="color-heimdall">Heimdall</span> is currently in development with no announced release date.</p>
			<h3 class="subtitle">Forseti</h3>
			<p class="description"><span class="color-forseti">Forseti</span> is a GUI-toolkit for <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span>.
				<span class="color-forseti">Forseti</span> allows you to customize <span class="color-tyr">Týr's</span> data fields and buttons to fit your organization's needs.
				Maybe your organization doesn't use 'Asset Tags', maybe you prefer 'Part Number' instead. Or perhaps you want to add more entries to the GUI and change some existing ones.
				Using <span class="color-forseti">Forseti</span>, you can make these changes and build a <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span> that fits your needs without having to dabble in code.
			</p>
			<p class="description">
				There's also an option to reset <span class="color-tyr">Týr's</span> values back to their default settings, in case you want to revert your changes.
			</p>
			<p class="subtitle">Here's what <span class="color-forseti">Forseti</span> looks like:</p>
			<img class="p-img" src="https://github.com/need4swede/ODIN/blob/main/Mimir/Documentation/img/forseti.png?raw=true" alt="forseti-gui">
			<h3 class="subtitle">How Does It Work?</h3>
			<h4 class="description">Administrators</h4>
			<p class="description">
				When an admin runs ODIN, the system verifies your credentials and a request is sent to <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span>, the admin front-end module. 
				<span class="color-tyr">Týr</span> then communicates with <span class="color-mimir">Mimir</span>, the system responsible for database entries and amemmendments.
				These two work together, <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span> acting as the console interface and <span class="color-mimir">Mimir</span> managing the back-end database. 
			</p>
			<h4 class="description">Clients</h4>
			<p class="description">
				When client users run ODIN, or admins accessing the system outside of their network, the requests need to first pass through <span class="color-heimdall">Heimdall</span>
				to grant database access. <span class="color-heimdall">Heimdall</span> acts as a gatekeeper, only granting users access to parts of <span class="color-mimir">Mimir's</span>
				database. The various credentials are setup within a configuration called the <em>Bifröst,</em> which <span class="color-heimdall">Heimdall</span> uses to authenticate access. 
				<span class="color-heimdall">Heimdall</span>, unlike <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span>, does not have any admninistrating properties and is only used to view data. However,
				<span class="color-heimdall">Heimdall</span> will allow users to send requests to administrators in the form of notations, called <em>Ravens</em>, which admins can use to fulfill client
				side requests. 
			</p>
			<p class="description">
				Together, these modules allow administrators to create and manage multiple databases using an intuative and fully modular GUI, and designate access to appropriate end&ndash;users
				with a seperate client&ndash;side GUI. This is a great way to manage assets, equipment, licenses, technical knowledge, and lots more <em>&mdash; and it is 100% free and open sourced.</em>

						will ask a follow&ndash;up question to gather information about your asset. For example, if you select a network device, <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span> will ask for the device's IP Address.
						If you select a mobile device, such as a laptop or tablet, then <span class="color-tyr">Týr</span> will ask for the device's Serial Number. Devices that can be used over a network, but are being used
						purely as local devices, like a Local Printer, will prompt the user to designate a purpose, or use case, for the device instead of an IP Address.</p>

					<p><strong>Info</strong>&mdash; Additional Information about Asset</p>
					<p class="p-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Here you can add notes and more information about the device. It can also be used as a second&ndash;level
